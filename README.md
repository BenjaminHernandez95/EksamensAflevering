# Trip Planning Application


Overview
This API, built using Javalin, is designed for managing trips and their associated guides. 
It provides CRUD operations for trips and allows for assigning a guide to a specific trip. 
When retrieving a trip by its ID, the response also includes information about the guide leading that trip (if assigned).

### 3.3.5
Using PUT to Assign a Guide to a Trip
PUT was chosen over POST because we are updating an existing trip by adding a relationship, rather than creating a new resource. PUT is better for this type of update.
